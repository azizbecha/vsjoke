### What is VSJoke
It's simply a VSCode extension made for humour purposes by showing some random programming-related jokes to the user.

### How it works
VSJoke works as a webview, and every action/event will be detected by the `main.js` file and send requests to the [Joke API](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/) depends on the filer.

### How to install
It's pretty easy, like any other VSCode extension.
Just go to the extensions section in your IDE, search for `vsjoke`, click on the first one, hit install and here you go ðŸš€
